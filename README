NAME
    Acme::SuperCollider::Programming - Representing the Community for
    SuperCollider Programming

DESCRIPTION
    In a cruel under-representation of the true scale and awesomeness of the
    <SuperCollider Programming> community, one popular ranking index has
    ranked SuperCollider as the 96th most popular language.

    Clearly, this is not a realistic ranking of the SuperCollider
    Programming profession.

    To those who would undervalue the hard-working members of the
    SuperCollider Programming collective, we say NO! NO MORE!

    By leveraging the 3-4,000 pages that will be created for this
    distribution, mentioning Acme::SuperCollider::Programming, or
    "Acme-SuperCollider-Programming", all of which can be happily found with
    a search for "+"SuperCollider Programming"", this distribution will help
    to restore the ranking of the SuperCollider Programming language to a
    more accurate and realistic position.

SUPPORT
    Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at
